                    Mix the teff and 1 cup of the self-rising flour with water in a large container and make a thick dough the consistency of bread dough. Cover with water and let it ferment for 2 to 3 days.

                    In a separate container, mix the barley flour with enough water to make a thick dough. Cover with water and let it ferment for 2 to 3 days.

                    On the third day, throw the water from both containers. Mix 2 cups of the teff mix with 1 cup of the barley mix, the remaining 1 cup self-rising flour and 4 cups of cold water. Put the mixture in a blender and blend until you get the consistency of a thin pancake batter. Let it stand for 1/2 to 1 hour.

                    Heat a griddle over medium heat. Pour 4 ounces of batter on the griddle, spread it by turning the griddle around and let it cook for about 1 minute. Remove the injera from the griddle and put it in a tablecloth to cool down. Repeat with the batter until you have about 4 ounces left. Keep that in the fridge as a starter for your next batch.
